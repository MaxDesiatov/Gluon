  Tokamak provides a declarative, testable and scalable API for building UI 
  components backed by fully native views. You can use it for your new macOS apps 
  or add to existing apps with little effort and without rewriting the rest of 
  the code or changing the app's overall architecture.

  Tokamak recreates React Hooks API improving it with Swift's strong type 
  system, high performance and efficient memory management thanks to being 
  compiled to a native binary.
