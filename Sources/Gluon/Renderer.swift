/** Renderer protocol that renderers for all platforms must implement.
 It's up to a specific renderer to provide an initializer with an arbitrary
 signature that works well for that platform. Methods required by this

 the renderer about updates in the component tree.

   and `AppKit` respectively), but can also include other helper types like
   layout constraints (e.g. `NSLayoutConstraint`). A renderer would most
   probably create its own type hierarchy to be able to reason about
