# Building the `Renderer`

Now that we have a `Target`, we can start the `Renderer`:

```swift
public final class StaticHTMLRenderer: Renderer {
  public private(set) var reconciler: StackReconciler<StaticHTMLRenderer>?
  var rootTarget: HTMLTarget

  public var html: String {
    """
    <html>
    \(rootTarget.outerHTML)
    </html>
    """
  }
}
```

We start by declaring the `StackReconciler`. It will handle the app, while our `Renderer` can focus
on mounting and un-mounting `Views`.

```swift
...
public init<V: View>(_ view: V) {
  rootTarget = HTMLTarget(view, HTMLBody())
  reconciler = StackReconciler(
    view: view,
    target: rootTarget,
    renderer: self,
    environment: EnvironmentValues()
  ) { closure in
    fatalError("Stateful apps cannot be created with TokamakStaticHTML")
  }
}
```

Next we declare an initializer that takes a `View` and builds a reconciler. The reconciler takes the
`View`, our root `Target` (in this case, `HTMLBody`), the renderer (`self`), and any default
`EnvironmentValues` we may need to setup. The closure at the end is the scheduler. It tells the
reconciler when it can update. In this case, we wonâ€™t need to update, so we can crash.

`HTMLBody` is declared like so:

```swift
struct HTMLBody: AnyHTML {
  let tag: String = "body"
  let innerHTML: String? = nil
  let attributes: [String : String] = [:]
  let listeners: [String : Listener] = [:]
}
```

## Mounting

Now that we have a reconciler, we need to be able to mount the `HTMLTargets` it asks for.

```swift
public func mountTarget(to parent: HTMLTarget, with host: MountedHost) -> HTMLTarget? {
  // 1.
  guard let html = mapAnyView(
    host.view,
    transform: { (html: AnyHTML) in html }
  ) else {
    // 2.
    if mapAnyView(host.view, transform: { (view: ParentView) in view }) != nil {
      return parent
    }

    return nil
  }

  // 3.
  let node = HTMLTarget(host.view, html)
  parent.children.append(node)
  return node
}}
```

1. We use the `mapAnyView` function to convert the `AnyView` passed in to `AnyHTML`, which can be
   used with our `HTMLTarget`.
2. `ParentView` is a special type of `View` in Tokamak. It indicates that the view has no
   representation itself, and is purely a container for children (e.g. `ForEach` or `Group`).
3. We create a new `HTMLTarget` for the view, assign it as a child of the parent, and return it.

The other two functions required by the `Renderer` protocol can crash, as `TokamakStaticHTML`
doesnâ€™t support state changes:

```swift
public func update(target: HTMLTarget, with host: MountedHost) {
  fatalError("Stateful apps cannot be created with TokamakStaticHTML")
}

public func unmount(
  target: HTMLTarget,
  from parent: HTMLTarget,
  with host: MountedHost,
  completion: @escaping () -> ()
) {
  fatalError("Stateful apps cannot be created with TokamakStaticHTML")
}
```

If you are creating a `Renderer` that supports state changes, hereâ€™s a quick synopsis:

- `func update` - Mutate the `target` to match the `host`.
- `func unmount` - Remove the `target` from the `parent`, and call `completion` once it has been
  removed.

Now that we can mount, letâ€™s give it a try:

```swift
struct ContentView : View {
  var body: some View {
    Text("Hello, world!")
  }
}

let renderer = StaticHTMLRenderer(ContentView())
print(renderer.html)
```

This spits out:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <span style="...">Hello, world!</span>
  </body>
</html>
```

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ You successfully wrote a `Renderer`. We canâ€™t wait to see what platforms youâ€™ll
bring Tokamak to.
