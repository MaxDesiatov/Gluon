## SwiftUI-compatible framework for building browser apps with WebAssembly

![CI status](https://github.com/swiftwasm/Tokamak/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=main)

At the moment Tokamak implements a very basic subset of SwiftUI. Its DOM renderer supports
a few view types and modifiers (you can check the current list in [the progress document](docs/progress.md)),
and a new `HTML` view for constructing arbitrary HTML. The long-term goal of Tokamak is to implement
as much of SwiftUI API as possible and to provide a few more helpful additions that simplify HTML
and CSS interactions.

If there's some SwiftUI API that's missing but you'd like to use it, please review the existing
[issues](https://github.com/swiftwasm/Tokamak/issues) and [PRs](https://github.com/swiftwasm/Tokamak/pulls)
to get more details about the current status, or [create a new issue](https://github.com/swiftwasm/Tokamak/issues/new)
to let us prioritize the development based on the demand. We also try to make the development of
views and modifiers easier (with the help from the `HTML` view, see [the example
below](https://github.com/swiftwasm/Tokamak#arbitrary-html)), so pull requests are very welcome! Don't
forget to check [the "Contributing" section](https://github.com/swiftwasm/Tokamak#contributing) first.

## Getting started

Tokamak relies on [`carton`](https://carton.dev) as a primary build tool. Please follow
[installation instructions](https://github.com/swiftwasm/carton#requirements) for `carton` first.

After `carton` is successfully installed, type `carton dev --product TokamakDemo` in the
root directory of the cloned Tokamak repository. This will build the demo project and its
dependencies and launch a development HTTP server. You can then open
[http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/) in your browser to interact with the demo.

### Example code

Tokamak API attempts to resemble SwiftUI API as much as possible. The main difference is
that you add `import TokamakDOM` instead of `import SwiftUI` in your files:

```swift
#if os(WASI)
import TokamakDOM
#else
import SwiftUI
#endif

struct Counter: View {
  @State var count: Int
  let limit: Int

  var body: some View {
    count < limit ?
      AnyView(
        VStack {
          Button("Increment") { count += 1 }
          Text("\(count)")
        }
      ) : AnyView(
        VStack { Text("Limit exceeded") }
      )
  }
}
```

You can then render your view in any DOM node captured with
[JavaScriptKit](https://github.com/kateinoigakukun/JavaScriptKit/), just
pass it as an argument to the `DOMRenderer` initializer together with your view:

```swift
import JavaScriptKit
import TokamakDOM

let document = JSObjectRef.global.document.object!

let divElement = document.createElement!("div").object!
let renderer = DOMRenderer(Counter(count: 5, limit: 15), divElement)

let body = document.body.object!
_ = body.appendChild!(divElement)
```

### Arbitrary HTML

With the `HTML` view you can also render any HTML you want, including inline SVG:

```swift
struct SVGCircle: View {
  var body: some View {
    HTML("svg", ["width": "100", "height": "100"]) {
      HTML("circle", [
        "cx": "50", "cy": "50", "r": "40",
        "stroke": "green", "stroke-width": "4", "fill": "yellow",
      ])
    }
  }
}
```

### Arbitrary styles and scripts

While `JavaScriptKit` is a great option for occasional interactions with JavaScript,
sometimes you need to inject arbitrary scripts or styles, which can be done through direct
DOM access:

```swift
_ = document.head.object!.insertAdjacentHTML!("beforeend", #"""
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.27.0/moment.min.js"></script>
"""#)
_ = document.head.object!.insertAdjacentHTML!("beforeend", #"""
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/semantic-ui/2.4.1/semantic.min.css">
"""#)
```

This way both [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) styles and [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)
localized date formatting (or any arbitrary style/script/font added that way) are available in your
app.

### Modular structure

Tokamak is built with modularity in mind, providing a cross-platform `TokamakCore` module and
separate modules for platform-specific renderers. Currently, the only available renderer module
is `TokamakDOM`, but we intend to provide other renderers in the future, such as `TokamakHTML`
for static websites and server-side rendering. Tokamak users only need to import a renderer module
they would like to use, while `TokamakCore` is hidden as an "internal" `Tokamak` package target.
Unfortunately, Swift does not allow us to specify that certain symbols in `TokamakCore` are private 
to a package, but they need to stay `public` for renderer modules to get access to them. Thus, the
current workaround is to mark those symbols with underscores in their names to indicate this. It
can be formulated as these "rules":

1. If a symbol is restricted to a module and has no `public` access control, no need for an underscore.
2. If a symbol is part of a public renderer module API (e.g. `TokamakDOM`), no need for an underscore, 
users may use those symbols directly, and it is re-exported from `TokamakCore` by the renderer module 
via `public typealias`.
3. If a function or a type have `public` on them only by necessity to make them available in `TokamakDOM`,
but unavailable to users (or not intended for public use), underscore is needed to indicate that.

The benefit of separate modules is that they allow us to provide separate renderers for different platforms.
Users can pick and choose what they want to use, e.g. purely static websites would use only `TokamakHTML`, 
single-page apps would use `TokamakDOM`, maybe in conjuction with `TokamakHTML` for pre-rendering. As we'd
like to try to implement a native renderer for Android at some point, probably in a separate `TokamakAndroid`
module, Android apps would use `TokamakAndroid` with no need to be aware of any of the web modules.

### Sponsorship

If this library saved you any amount of time or money, please consider [sponsoring
the work of its maintainer](https://github.com/sponsors/MaxDesiatov). While some of the
sponsorship tiers give you priority support or even consulting time, any amount is
appreciated and helps in maintaining the project.

### Coding Style

This project uses [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat)
and [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to
enforce formatting and coding style. We encourage you to run SwiftFormat within
a local clone of the repository in whatever way works best for you either
manually or automatically via an [Xcode
extension](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat#xcode-source-editor-extension),
[build phase](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat#xcode-build-phase) or
[git pre-commit
hook](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat#git-pre-commit-hook) etc.

To guarantee that these tools run before you commit your changes on macOS, you're encouraged
to run this once to set up the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook:

```
brew bundle # installs SwiftLint, SwiftFormat and pre-commit
pre-commit install # installs pre-commit hook to run checks before you commit
```

Refer to [the pre-commit documentation page](https://pre-commit.com/) for more details
and installation instructions for other platforms.

SwiftFormat and SwiftLint also run on CI for every PR and thus a CI build can
fail with inconsistent formatting or style. We require CI builds to pass for all
PRs before merging.
