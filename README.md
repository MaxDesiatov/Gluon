Tokamak provides a declarative, testable and scalable API for building UI
components backed by fully native views. You can use it for your new iOS apps or
add to existing apps with little effort and without rewriting the rest of the
code or changing the app's overall architecture.

### Important: SwiftUI compatibility

Current Tokamak API was designed and built at the end of 2018, months before SwiftUI was announced.
We do think that SwiftUI is the future of development not only for Apple's
platforms, but potentially other platforms too (Android, WebAssembly, Windows,
or your platform of choice). Thus, the short-term goal of Tokamak
is to make the API more compatible with SwiftUI. All contributions that help
us in achieving this goal are much appreciated. You can consider the current
Tokamak API as deprecated, but still usable for research and experimentation
purposes.
